# L-System-Procedural-generation-of-a-Tree
This project includes classes that generates a procedural tree based on L-system rule-set. These classes are a part of a 3D graphics project that uses direct X to showcase procedural development of trees.
#Class "lSystem" includes the axiom and the ruleset from which the final string will be calculated through the iteration. Iterating 7 times through the ruleset has given optimal result as per the author of this code.
#Class "lTree" interprets the string and initializes the buffer as per the vertex and index count.
#The render function is called from the application class of the project (not included in the repository)
